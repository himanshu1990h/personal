Hello Friends, i am himanshu working as technical lead in team turkey, covid-19 has brought along alot of challanges but a lot of opportunity. While 
the time was in real sense of testinomy for us to show the complete agile bheaviour in accordance to the circumstances
slowly but steadily the whole team adopted well. While we were working from home, one downside was we were not able to 
meet our collegues face to face and specially meeting room brainstoming sessions,coffe break discussion,Release parties were a major missing it
gave us a littlemore time to spend with our families and loved ones.
Team turkey anticipated well the challenges and made sure work is not at all getting impacted, Starting from lockdown we had almost 3 production
releases and all went very succesfull which itself speaks a lot about teams dedication and spirit, the same was appreciated by clients as well.
While we were little away from our friends and collegues we made sure we have regular interactions amongst us, we not only had the formal time bounded
online meetings but also made sure we have time for online fun friday meetups where team came up enjoyed their online ordered food together and also 
show their talent. We all made sure the travel time we knowcked off from our daily schedule gets utilized in something constructive whether it was a long forgooten
hobby or learning something new, and the results were really amazing when team came up with new ideas,implimented their learnings and as well
created a stage to show their talent as well.
While we still live in the same era,we reamin optimistic and convert these hard times into an opportunity.
Till we meet again in office, stay indor stay safe.
